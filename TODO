The webapp obviously needs to be usable with a mouse. But
I also want it to be as usable as possible with the keyboard
thus, moving the selection with arrow keys, ... Also, maybe
it would be useful to have a command mode where one can enter
commands (e.g. 'twill 2/2'). This would also help with
further automation stuff (macros, checkerlang). But it needs
to be unobtrusive.
