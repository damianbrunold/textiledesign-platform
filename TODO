jbead: when height is smaller than screen height, then we need to
correctly limit the display and the interaction. For the draft, this
should work now. But for the other views, the limit may be within a
row, thus we only draw part of the last row. And also, the interaction
(i.e. contains-method) needs to check for this...

The webapp obviously needs to be usable with a mouse. But
I also want it to be as usable as possible with the keyboard
thus, moving the selection with arrow keys, ... Also, maybe
it would be useful to have a command mode where one can enter
commands (e.g. 'twill 2/2'). This would also help with
further automation stuff (macros, checkerlang). But it needs
to be unobtrusive.
