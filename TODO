- clone public pattern of other user: when you
  view the pattern, you cannot save, but instead
  you can "clone", thus creating a copy of the
  pattern for your account. The original creator
  has to be retained in the pattern, e.g. in the
  field "original_author". Maybe we could also
  retain the original author until the pattern
  is edited and saved by the new user.

- before closing editor check for changes and
  prompt to save them. Or autosave?

The webapp obviously needs to be usable with a mouse. But
I also want it to be as usable as possible with the keyboard
thus, moving the selection with arrow keys, ... Also, maybe
it would be useful to have a command mode where one can enter
commands (e.g. 'twill 2/2'). This would also help with
further automation stuff (macros, checkerlang). But it needs
to be unobtrusive.
